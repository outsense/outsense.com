      We will make you live in anywhere,<br />
      even if, there is in SPACE.

    <p>
      Our name, OUTSENSE, comes from "We getting OUT from boring common SENSE".<br />
      We think space has ultimate power to change our perspective dramatically,
      and want to make people feel more bright.
    </p>
    <p>
    Living outside of the earth, then human being will meet unexpected world,<br />
    experience, feeling, culture, ability... completely new thing.
    </p>
    <p>
    For these future, we promote space development by providing space residence.
